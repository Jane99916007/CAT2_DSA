# Differentiate between arrays and linked lists according to:
## a) Memory Allocation
Arrays align the elements of memory side by side, assigning them to contiguous memory spaces. The memory assigned to the array gets decided at compile time
and cannot be changed at run time which may make it more memory efficient
depending on the size being predetermined and constant while linked lists elements
are stored at non contiguous memory locations making elements to be located
at anywhere.Every node in it has a pointer to the next element as well as data
making it more memory efficient.

## b)Perfomance
Arrays perform extremely well and have constant time operation across any element usinggiven index.They also 
store in adjacent memory and so their arrangement is also superior
for cache locality and hence faster iteration through elements while linked lists only
allow sequential access that takes O(n) time to get the nth node, since
we would have to traverse from the beginning. It has scattered memory allocation
leading to poor cache performance and they also require additional memory
to store their references which provides more flexible memory arrangement.

## c)Insertion and Deletion Operations
Arrays are good at insertion or removal of elements at the end but operations
for middle bits or the head are O(n) time as elements need to move 
to preserve contiguity.These operations are very resource consuming
as they require many small arrays and can re-create new arrays to support.
On the other hand, linked lists allow insertion and deletion at the beginning
in O(1) constant time through simple update references. Unfortunately,
both of these operations require transversal time and the latter is 
used for changing the structure of the given data.
